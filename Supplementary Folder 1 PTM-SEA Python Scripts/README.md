# PTM-SEA Scripts

The Python 3 scripts in this directory are capable of taking an Excel file generated by PeptideDepot and performing PTM-SEA using ssGSEA2.0.R. Below will be a brief description of the automation script, and subsequent directories will have descriptions of their contents.

## automate_ptm_sea.py

The scripts automate_ptm_sea.py wraps together three scripts from the ./py_scripts directory. In doing so, it performs four basic steps:

* Conversion of the PeptideDepot excel file into a .gct format with flanking sequences (+/- 7 amino acids on either side of the PTM site) and raw intensity values or replicate condensed **q**-values for each condition (or comparison)
* Writing an R (4.1.0) file that can run ssGSEA2.0.R on a particular .gct file and running said R file.
* Taking the output of ssGSEA2.0.R and parsing the Normalized Enrichment Scores and adjusted p-values (q values).
* Creating heatmaps using the NES for each signature set and their corresponding q values

## generate_lck_abundance_graph.py

This script simply generates the plot used in Figure 3D. First the Supplementary Table 6 excel file is read in (that file must be in the same directory as the script), then uses the signal from total protein (top group) to normalize the signal from Lck (bottom group), then plot the normalized points with SEM bars and significance indicators. 

## extract_kegg_go_data.py

This script is not used in the manuscript, but it finds the KEGG and GO categorical membership for peptides with significant changes (q < 0.05 for comparisons between time points) and plots histograms representing the categories with significant changes.
