Python >= 3.8.5

managing_ssgsea_outputs.py

=================================================================================================
This file is meant to take the combined output file from ssGSEA2, parse out the 'value' and
'fdr.pvalue' columns, and write them to a new file.

The imp_main() or cmd_main() should only be run after the pepdep_to_gct.py and the
generate_ssgsea_files.py scritps, or at least ssGSEA2.0 had been run on a set of files in
a directory.

=================================================================================================
Arguments:

    Required:
  CMD    IMP
args[1] ([0])  ->  The directory holding the outputs of PTM-SEA.
args[2] ([1])  ->  The name of the combined output file from PTM-SEA. It should be of the form
                   <some_tag>-combined.gct

    Optional:
  CMD    IMP
args[3] ([2])  ->  The delimiter for the ssGSEA output files. They should all be tab delimited,
                   so there is no reason to set this argument manually.
args[4] ([3])  ->  The name you would like to give the output of this script. The default is
                   "combined_output_heatmap.txt", which is perfectly fine.

=================================================================================================
Returns: None
